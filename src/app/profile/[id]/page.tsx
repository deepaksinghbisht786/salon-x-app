Okay, let's break down how you can build your salon app with Next.js, focusing on folder structure, tech stack, and a step-by-step approach.

## Suggested Folder Structure for Your Next.js Salon App

Given the features you described, a feature-based folder structure within the `app` directory of Next.js 13 will be well-organized and scalable. Here's a proposed structure:

```
app/
├── _components/           # Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals etc.)
├── _lib/                 # Utility functions, helper functions, database connection, OTP logic
├── _styles/              # Global styles, theme configuration
├── auth/                 # Authentication related pages and logic
│   ├── customer/        # Customer signup/login
│   │   ├── page.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── stylist/         # Stylist signup/login
│   │   ├── page.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── business/        # Business Owner signup/login
│   │   ├── page.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   └── components/      # Shared authentication components (OTP input, etc.)
├── booking/              # Booking flow pages
│   ├── [bookingId]/      # Dynamic route for specific booking details
│   │   └── page.jsx
│   ├── page.jsx         # Main booking page/calendar view
│   └── components/
├── business/             # Business/Stylist profile and management
│   ├── stylist/         # Stylist dashboard and profile
│   │   ├── page.jsx
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── owner/           # Business Owner dashboard, profile, staff management
│   │   ├── page.jsx
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── components/      # Shared business components (service forms, etc.)
├── customer/             # Customer facing pages
│   ├── salons/[salonId]/ # Dynamic route for salon details page
│   │   └── page.jsx
│   ├── page.jsx         # Customer main page (salon listings, etc.)
│   └── components/
├── home/                 # Home page (common for all users)
│   └── page.jsx
├── salon/                # Salon related components and logic (might be merged into business or customer)
│   └── components/
├── services/             # Service catalog or management (if needed as separate entity)
│   └── components/
├── api/                  # API routes for backend functionality
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── business/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── customer/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── booking/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── services/
└── layout.js             # Root layout for the app
└── page.js               # (Optional) If you have a default landing page

**Explanation of Folders:**

*   **`_components`**:  Holds reusable UI components that are used across different parts of your application. Components here are typically presentational and don't contain business logic directly.  Start with things like buttons, input fields, cards, modals, loaders, etc.
*   **`_lib`**: Contains utility functions and helper code. This could include:
    *   Database connection setup (to MongoDB).
    *   OTP generation and verification logic.
    *   Date formatting functions.
    *   Any reusable business logic that isn't specific to a component.
*   **`_styles`**: For global CSS files, theme configurations (if using a theming library), or any global styling setups.
*   **`auth`**:  This is crucial for handling your three user roles.  Separate folders for `customer`, `stylist`, and `business` will keep your authentication logic clear. Inside each, you'll have your signup and login pages, and possibly components specific to each auth type.
*   **`booking`**: Contains pages and components related to the booking flow. This might include calendar views, booking forms, booking confirmation pages, and management of bookings.
*   **`business`**:  This folder is for features related to Stylists and Business Owners. You can further divide it into `stylist` and `owner` to manage their dashboards, profile settings, service management, and staff management (for business owners).
*   **`customer`**: Pages and components visible to customers. This includes the main customer dashboard where they see salon listings, salon detail pages, search/filter functionality, etc.
*   **`home`**: The home page of your application, which you mentioned is the same for all users.
*   **`salon`** (or `business`):  You might decide to keep salon-specific components here, or you could merge salon related logic into the `business` or `customer` folders depending on how you structure your data and features.  Consider if 'Salon' is a separate entity or just a 'Business' offering Salon services.
*   **`services`**:  If you have a complex service catalog or need to manage services as a separate entity, this folder can be useful. Otherwise, service management might live within the `business` folder.
*   **`api`**:  Next.js API routes go here.  Organize your API endpoints by feature area, mirroring your `app` directory structure if it makes sense (e.g., `api/auth`, `api/business`, `api/booking`).

## Recommended Tech Stack

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the tech stack you can use:

*   **Frontend Framework**: **Next.js (React)**
    *   For server-side rendering, routing, and API routes. Excellent for performance and SEO.
*   **Database**: **MongoDB**
    *   A NoSQL database that's flexible and easy to work with, especially during development.
    *   **Mongoose**:  An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Simplifies interaction with MongoDB.
*   **Authentication & Mobile OTP**: **Firebase Authentication or Twilio Verify**
    *   **Firebase Authentication**:  Offers easy integration with mobile OTP verification, user management, and is generally very developer-friendly. It handles a lot of the backend complexity for authentication.
    *   **Twilio Verify**: A dedicated service for SMS-based OTP verification. Powerful and customizable, but might be slightly more setup compared to Firebase for initial integration.
    *   **For learning, Firebase Authentication is likely easier to set up quickly.**
*   **State Management**: **React Context API or Zustand**
    *   **React Context API**: Built-in to React. Good for prop drilling avoidance and managing application-wide state. For a medium-sized app, it can be sufficient.
    *   **Zustand**:  A simpler and un-opinionated state management library. Easier to learn than Redux and can be a good alternative to Context for more complex state needs if you prefer a dedicated library.
*   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS**
    *   Utility-first CSS framework. Enables rapid styling directly in your JSX. Very popular in the Next.js ecosystem and promotes consistent design.
*   **Form Handling & Validation**: **React Hook Form and Zod (or Yup)**
    *   **React Hook Form**:  Excellent library for handling forms in React. It's performant, reduces boilerplate, and integrates well with validation.
    *   **Zod or Yup**:  Schema validation libraries.  Use Zod for better TypeScript support, or Yup if you prefer its API. These will help you define schemas to validate your form inputs on the frontend and backend.
*   **Payment Gateway**: **Stripe**
    *   Widely used, well-documented, and has a good developer experience. Offers comprehensive payment processing features.
*   **Image Upload & Storage**: **Cloudinary or Firebase Storage**
    *   **Cloudinary**:  A dedicated image and video management service. Handles uploads, transformations, and delivery efficiently.  Developer-friendly and provides a generous free tier.
    *   **Firebase Storage**: If you choose Firebase Authentication, using Firebase Storage for image uploads can simplify integration within the Firebase ecosystem.
*   **Terms & Privacy Policy**:  **Static Pages in Next.js or a CMS**
    *   For simple static pages, you can create `terms-and-conditions.jsx` and `privacy-policy.jsx` files in your `app` directory.
    *   If you anticipate needing to update these pages frequently, a lightweight CMS might be overkill for just these two pages, but something to consider for the future.

## Step-by-Step Development Plan

1.  **Setup Next.js and Tailwind CSS**:
    *   Create your Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest salon-app`.
    *   Configure Tailwind CSS in your project. Follow the Next.js and Tailwind CSS setup guides.

2.  **Initialize Firebase Project & Authentication (or Twilio)**:
    *   Set up a Firebase project on the Firebase Console.
    *   Initialize Firebase in your Next.js app.
    *   Implement mobile OTP verification using Firebase Authentication for all three user types (customer, stylist, business owner). Create signup and login pages in `app/auth/...`.

3.  **Connect to MongoDB**:
    *   Set up a MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas is a good cloud option for development).
    *   Use Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database from your Next.js API routes (in `_lib/dbConnect.js` for example).

4.  **Design MongoDB Schemas**:
    *   Plan your database schemas using Mongoose. Key collections will be:
        *   `User`:  Store user information (role, contact info, auth details, etc.) - use role to differentiate between customer, stylist, business.
        *   `BusinessProfile`:  Details for stylists and business owners (business name, services offered, address, hours, images, staff - for businesses).
        *   `Service`: Define the services offered (name, description, price, duration).
        *   `Booking`: Store booking information (customer, stylist/business, service, date/time, status, payment details).

5.  **Build Authentication API Routes and Pages**:
    *   Create API routes in `app/api/auth/...` to handle user signup and login, OTP verification, and user session management.
    *   Create the UI pages in `app/auth/...` using React Hook Form and validation with Zod/Yup for signup forms.
    *   Implement Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy acceptance for Stylist and Business Owner signup.  You can link to static pages or embed the content.

6.  **Develop Business/Stylist Profile Management**:
    *   Create API routes in `app/api/business/...` for creating and managing business profiles, services, staff (for businesses), business hours, and image uploads (using Cloudinary or Firebase Storage).
    *   Build UI pages in `app/business/...` for Stylists and Business Owners to manage their profiles, services, etc. Use React Hook Form for forms and handle image uploads.

7.  **Build Customer Home Page and Salon/Service Browsing**:
    *   Create API routes in `app/api/customer/...` or `app/api/services/...` to fetch salon/business profiles and services to display on the home page.
    *   Develop the home page in `app/home/page.jsx` and customer pages in `app/customer/...` to display services, top-rated salons, nearby salons, and implement search/filtering.

8.  **Implement Booking Flow**:
    *   Create API routes in `app/api/booking/...` for handling bookings, checking availability, and managing booking slots.
    *   Build booking flow pages in `app/booking/...` allowing customers to select services, time slots (at home or salon), and confirm bookings.

9.  **Integrate Payment Gateway (Stripe)**:
    *   Set up Stripe and integrate it into your booking confirmation flow. Create API routes in `app/api/payment/...` to handle payment processing.
    *   Implement UI components in your booking flow to handle payment interactions with Stripe.

10. **Testing and Refinement**:
    *   Thoroughly test each feature as you build it.
    *   Test authentication, profile management, service browsing, booking flow, and payment.
    *   Get feedback and iterate on your design and features.

This detailed structure and plan should give you a solid foundation to start building your salon app. Remember to break down each step further into smaller tasks and tackle them incrementally. Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!
